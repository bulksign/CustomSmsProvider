# CustomSmsProvider for Bulksign platform
This is sample code that demonstrates how to implement a custom sms provider for the [Bulksign](https://bulksign.com) platform.

The code itself is very simple. This references the Bulksign.Extensibility library from NuGet and contains a class that implements the ISmsProvider interface. 

```
public class MyCustomSmsProvider : ISMSProvider
```
